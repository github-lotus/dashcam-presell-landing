Got out of a ticket!

The clarity of the camera is incredible - I was able to use the footage as evidence against the traffic violation ticket that I was issued. Highly recommend this product!

Great to keep your car safe!

For someone like me who travels a lot - the 24/7 parking monitor is a great feature, the recording is HD quality - it also records audio clearly. Unlike the last Dash Camera that I had - this has a wide angle view & dual front and rear camera as well.
